 * run itself (where it starts, where the fingers lift) is `useTrackpadSwipe`'s;
 * this is what a page does with the run's summed `deltaX`.
 *
 * The offset is the panel's distance from its resting place, px: 0 is fully
 * open, `travel` fully out. The release is the phone's rule from
 * `useDrawerSwipe`, so a trackpad and a finger settle a panel the same way.
