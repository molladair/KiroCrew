"""A creator's approval-mode change reaches the sessions it already created.

``session_create`` copies the creator's posture at birth only. The repro: a person
dispatches workers from a conductor, then turns the conductor to Trust; before this
fix every worker stayed on the posture it was born with and kept asking. These pin
the follow-on rules: trusted -> trusted, normal -> normal, a lower creator never
raises a worker, a worker whose own mode a person set keeps it, a raise needs a
gateway-authored creation edge, and an app or cron caller can only lower.
